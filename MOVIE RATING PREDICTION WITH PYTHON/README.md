# 🎬 Movie Rating Prediction with Python

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Movie Rating Prediction** project aims to build a machine learning model that can **predict the rating of a movie** based on features such as **genre, director, actors, and other attributes**.  
By analyzing historical movie data, we try to uncover the key factors that influence how movies are rated by users or critics.

This project demonstrates the full pipeline of:
- **Data Collection & Exploration**
- **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
- **Machine Learning Model Building**
- **Evaluation & Prediction**

## 🚀 Key Features
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand patterns, correlations, and trends in movie datasets.  
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, encoding categorical features (genre, actors, directors), scaling numerical features.  
- 🏗️ **Feature Engineering:** Creating meaningful features from raw attributes (e.g., one-hot encoding for genres, director popularity scores).  
- 🤖 **Modeling:** Using regression techniques (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, XGBoost, etc.) to predict ratings.  
- 📈 **Evaluation:** Comparing model performance using metrics such as **RMSE, MAE, and R² score**.  
- 🎯 **Prediction:** Estimating ratings for new/unseen movies.

## 📊 Workflow
1. **Data Collection:** Gather historical movie data (IMDB, TMDB, Kaggle datasets).  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handle missing, duplicate, or inconsistent data.  
3. **EDA:** Explore distributions, correlations, and feature importance.  
4. **Feature Engineering:** Transform categorical variables (genre, director, actors).  
5. **Model Training:** Train multiple regression models and tune hyperparameters.  
6. **Evaluation:** Use metrics like **RMSE** and **R²** to assess model performance.  
7. **Prediction:** Generate rating predictions for new movie inputs.
