# 📈 Sales Prediction Using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Sales Prediction** project focuses on forecasting product sales by analyzing key factors such as **advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and advertising platform selection**.  

By leveraging **machine learning techniques in Python**, businesses can make **data-driven decisions** about advertising strategies, optimize marketing budgets, and maximize sales potential.  

This project demonstrates the complete journey from **data preprocessing to model building and evaluation**.

## 🚀 Key Features
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand sales patterns and the effect of advertising strategies.  
- 🧹 **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.  
- 🏗️ **Feature Engineering:** Create meaningful features (e.g., ad cost per channel, customer segments).  
- 🤖 **Modeling:** Apply regression models such as **Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost**.  
- 📈 **Evaluation:** Assess predictions using metrics like **RMSE, MAE, and R² score**.  
- 🎯 **Prediction:** Forecast sales based on given advertising and market parameters.
